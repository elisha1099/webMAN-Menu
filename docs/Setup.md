# Setup

Setting up webMAN Menu is super easy, especially if you've used iOS shortcuts in the past. Here is what to do;

1. Download the [Toolbox Pro](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1476205977) app onto your iPhone/iPad. This app has a pro version but it is **not** required by webMAN Menu.
2. Download the latest version of the shortcut from the [releases page](https://github.com/elisha1099/webMAN-Menu/releases).
3. Open the downloaded `.shortcut` file, after it opens in shortcuts, add it.
4. Run the shortcut by finding it in the app and tapping it's icon.
5. If it's your first time using this shortcut, you will have to run setup. After dismissing the alert, tap the setup option and follow the directions from there.
