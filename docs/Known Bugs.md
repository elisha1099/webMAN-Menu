### NSString Conversion Error
This error occurs during the 'Choose from list' action because the ip.txt file has desynced from your device and the menu bugs out when trying to display it.

Workaround:
- Open files and navigate to "iCloud Drive > webMAN-Menu > config > ip"
- Press and hold the "ip.txt" file
- Tap Quick Look
This syncs the file and fixes the bug
