### Known Bugs
- NSString conversion error
  - This bug occurs when the ip.txt file becomes desynced with your phone, since it is saved in iCloud storage. To fix this, Open the files app, navigate to `iCloud Drive > webMAN-Menu > config > ip` then tap and hold the ip.txt file and press Quick Look. This will open the file and sync it to your device again.
